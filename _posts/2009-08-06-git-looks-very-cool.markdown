title: Git Looks Very Cool
---

I've been reading up on, and playing around with, [Git][1] and I have to say it
is looking like a very nice tool for managing source code. [GitHub][2] looks
very nice too so I'm trying out some of its features including [GitHub Pages][3]
and [Jekyll][4]. I don't think we are going to abandon svn immediately but I
could see myself starting to use git-svn and phasing out svn over time.
